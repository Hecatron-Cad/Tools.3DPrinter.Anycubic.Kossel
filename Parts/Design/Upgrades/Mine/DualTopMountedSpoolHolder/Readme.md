Changes made:

  * It looks like this was originally for a smaller printer, so I've increased the size
  * Holes repositioned for extrusion

TODO

  * need to look at some countersunk, buttonhead or caphead bolts
    And adjust the parts accordingly
  * check clearances for skate bearings
  * check slot positions for extending the number of reels
  * check the reel sizes
  * check the bolt clearances
