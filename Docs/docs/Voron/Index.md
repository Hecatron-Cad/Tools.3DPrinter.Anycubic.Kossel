# Voron Upgrade

## Filament Type

For conventional voron's they have a heated chamber which can go up to around 60C.
For this reason the recomended print material is ABS.

Materials have a glass transition temperature and a melting temperature.  
The glass transition temperature is warm enough for material to bend but not fully melt.  

In the case of PETG this isn't as temperature resistant as ABS but has a glass transition of around 85.
However it's more flexible and not as rigid as ABS

For standard PLA the glass transition is between 50-80C and the melting temperature is around 170-180.  
For PLA+ some types have a higher heat resistance but require annelaing for that to work.

### Part Annealing

Annelaing PLA can make it much more resistant to high temps.  
But it can warp and expand / contract which needs to be accounted for.

This may mean printing parts twice.
Once to figure out what the annelaing does to the dimentions, then second with the size compensation.
Also I need a temperature controlled toaster oven.

The other approach is to print in ASA and avoid ABS
