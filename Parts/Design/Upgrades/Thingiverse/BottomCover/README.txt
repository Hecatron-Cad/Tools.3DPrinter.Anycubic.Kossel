# Summary

These covers are protective covers to prevent anything from getting into the belt drive, thus blocking the system.

For the cooling of the stepper motors I added ventilation openings in "Deltastyle look".
This also upgrades the look.
The covers can be mounted without disassembling the printer.


For the assembly you need:

12 pieces M4 screws with 10mm length
12 pieces M4 T-Nuts.

Update1: Anycubic logo added (both versions are in the download list, with and without logo ...)
Update2: On one side was an error in the anycubic logo, this has been corrected. Sorry...
