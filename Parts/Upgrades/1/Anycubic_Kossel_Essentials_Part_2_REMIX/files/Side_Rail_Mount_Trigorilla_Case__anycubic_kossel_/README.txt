# Summary

adds to holes to side to vertical mount on rail
made bottom piece slightly smaller as didnt fit before
Added wings and multiple holes to the bottom mount so you can adjust height and so mountings dont place metal under the cpu 

Added a second version if you want to mount the case from the bottom to the rail (I think thats better) and removed much of the vent holes (not needed, the side has plenty)

Added  more top and bottom space for wires to go in

Reinforced screw holes and corrected threads

Added Precision to size

Added wings on bottom plate with multiple holes to adjust height

Sliced off 0.6 of bottom after seeing printing error (non walls were only printing on 2nd layer) this will ensure flatness.

ToDo: screws from top friction hold the lower plate. 4 M5 short screws. So the outer holes on the lower plate are not needed and should be removed, but they don't cause any issues if you have that version. 

ToDo: Make z groves so bottom plate slides into mb mount plate for easy install ...
ToDo: Make out screws threat into inner plate. Not really needed will get to someday...

To print with bottom mount into rail you will need feet, I recommend my racketball feet. 

The three holes on the bottom are so you can move the case slightly up or down depending on where you need it to be. 

Wires tend to come out top side and bottom. Top for the ones going to the effector plate. Most of the rest come out the side opposite the usb connector.

Fan should be a standard 40mm and m4 screws but I have to check... 

Don't use supports  they shouldn't be needed

Screws: Outer screws are M5, short
              MB screws are M4 short
              frame hammerhead screws are whatever you want, they are not threaded holes but they can't be the shorted ones in the kit, I used 2nd shortest so they have room to catch

Wiring: 
     Power CAbles: out of bottom hole
     LCD, Z Stops, Base Thermister: Right Side Hole
     Everything that goes to the effector/nozzle: Top Hole

I could try to bend the DC wires but they are quite stiff so its best to route them through the bottom hole. An alternative is to route them INSIDE through the bottom plate back to the PSU
