# Summary

I loved the Kossel Base Stand thing, I found it very useful when I needed to put all my electronics below the Kossel Mini I was building. But I needed a little more, to have both a breathing air for the electronics fans and some dampener effect against the table. So I designed this. 

Although they fit tightly inside the holes of the original piece and the printer weight keeps it in place. I added a couple of screw holes on the sides to fix them with a couple of L pieces (design coming up) to base stand. 

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK2S
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
You might need to play a little bit with the # of perimeters and the infill %. I expect to this parameters differ depending on the printer weight and the TPE type you use. 

I did several tries to get the right balance between toughness vs amortiguation. For my Kossel Mini (a very standard build), including the weight of the PSU and filament roll these are my results:
- 15% infill, 2 perimeters: Very squishy. It lost shape right way.
- 25% infill, 4 perimeters: Very stiff. Almost a solid non flexible piece. 
- 20% infill 3 perimeters: Just right. 

# Post-Printing

Don't be discourage for these images, the TPE I've got seems to be low quality, also I'm still tweaking my parameters trying to get rid of the blob and hairs.
