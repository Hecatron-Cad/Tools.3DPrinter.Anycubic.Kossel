# Metal Printing

## Overview / Idea

1. Get some powdered metal
2. put a layer down of 0.1mm / using a roller to flattern
3. raise the roller by 0.1mm each time
4. fix the powder in place using a binder sprayed from a print head

Once part is complete
1. place into a crucible
2. surround with sand
3. place in oven to cure metal
