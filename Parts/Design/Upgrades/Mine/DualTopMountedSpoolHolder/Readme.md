# Readme

The original version was from here

  * https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2587079/files

Changes made:

  * It looks like this was originally for a smaller printer, so I've increased the size
    For a Anycubic Linear Plus
  * Holes repositioned to fit the M4 screws to attach to the aluminum
  * I'm using the same 8mm inner dia skate bearings
    But I've replaced the bolts with countersunk M6 50mm ones and a 6mm to 8mm spacer
    since the M6 bolts are easier to get for countersunk heads

## Typical bolts needed

For the frame

  * M4 1.0mm socket head screws x9
  * M4 T Nuts x9
  
TODO screws / nuts to hold frame

For the reels

  * 50mm M6 counter sunk bolt x1 per reel
  * 608Z skateboard bearings x2 per reel
  * M6 Nuts x2 per reel
  * M6 washers x2 per reel

## Typical Reel sizes

I measured some reel sizes I had lying around

  * Black PLA1 - 52.5mm dia / 69mm deep
  * Red PETG - 53.3mm dia / 75.5mm deep
  * Blue PETG - 52mm dia / 80mm deep
  * Black PLA2 - 72.6mm dia / 66mm deep
