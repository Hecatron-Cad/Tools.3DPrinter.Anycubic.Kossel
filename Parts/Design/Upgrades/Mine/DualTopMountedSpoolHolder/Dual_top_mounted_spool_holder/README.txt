# Summary

I designed this spool holder because I upgraded my printer for dual filament printing.
I love top mounted spool holders but they seem a little flimsy to hold two filament spools.
I need a Hard-Core spool holder for this...

It's designed for 52mm hole spools, the small spacer is for 750g spools (55mm max width) and the large is for 1kg spools (80mm max width).

Each spindle takes two 608Z skateboard bearings.
For the brackets you need 9-M4x10mm socket head cap screws, 9-M4 T-nuts or square nuts,
For the holder you need 3-M4x15mm socket head cap screws, 3-M4 Ny-loc nut, 3-M4 washer.
For the main spindle you need 1-M8x45mm countersunk bolt, 1-M8 Ny-loc nut, 1-M8 washer.
For the spacers you need 1-M8x50mm countersunk bolt, 1-M8 Ny-loc nut, 1-M8 washer.

ATT:
Each spacer prints with the bolt hole closed by two layers for the hexagonal hole to print correctly (see foto).
The tightness of the Ny-loc nut adjusts the drag on the spindle so the spools don't unwind by themselves.
The spools have to be mounted with opposite feed directions (see last foto).
