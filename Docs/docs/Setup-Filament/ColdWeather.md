# Cold Weather Printing

In order to get the print to stick to the bed

  * Check the bed temperature, when set at 60C it was only reaching 50C
    So I had to up it to 75C
  * Change the initial layer height from 0.3 to something lower such as 0.1mm
  * Set the print speed for the first layer to around 30% or "10"
